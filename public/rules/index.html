<p>Welcome to the ETOS rules compendium. These rules apply to all ETOS tournaments and leagues, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Thank you to Coscord for providing the base rulebook</p>
<p><em>Last updated 8 April 2024</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<p><strong>Tournament Administrator (“Admin”)</strong></p>
<p>Tournament Administrators are people that help plan and run events. Any and all questions or concerns regarding ETOS and
tournaments in general should be directed to them.</p>
<p><strong>Tournament Organizer (“TO”)</strong></p>
<p>Tournament Organizers are people who are in charge of organizing and running their respective tournaments. Any and all questions or concerns regarding specific tournaments should be directed to them.</p>
<p><strong>“The ETOS Server”, “The Discord”, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Refers to the discord server that typically hosts &amp; is home to ETOS tournaments and leagues.</p>
<p><strong>Series vs Match vs Set vs Goal</strong></p>
<p>A “series” is the largest unit of competition and is the matchup between two teams.
A “match” or a “game” is one start-to-finish game of Omega Strikers from queuing to the results screen. A match of Omega Strikers concludes when one team has won 3 sets.
A “set” is the in-game defined instance of a team scoring three goals and entering the Awakening Draft.
A “goal” is one successful scoring where the core crosses over a team’s goal line.</p>
<p><strong>Best of X (“BoX”)</strong></p>
<p>In a “Best of X” series format, teams play a Series of matches until a winner is decided. The Series winner will be the first team to reach the required amount of game wins (majority of the total amount of games). Common match lengths include Best of 1, 3, 5, or 7.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-registration-and-eligibility">1. Registration and Eligibility</h2>
<p><strong>1.1. Team Registration</strong></p>
<p>In order to enter a tournament or league, players will typically register with a Start.gg account and apply with a roster, as a team, to the tournament website. This will not apply to all tournaments or leagues, please check for each individual tournament.</p>
<p>Players are expected to join the discord server (<a href="https://discord.gg/Qt3tKm7wwT)">https://discord.gg/Qt3tKm7wwT)</a>, and follow the behavioral guidelines of the server as outlined.</p>
<p>It is recommended that players have notifications on for ETOS announcements &amp; announcements of any events they are taking part in.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Team Rosters</strong></p>
<p>Any active roster must contain 3 starters and up to 3 substitutes and 2 coaches.</p>
<p>No current Odyssey members may enter or be a part of a participating roster.</p>
<p>Players/Coaches may not be a participant of more than one team at a time at any simultaneously-occurring tournament or league.</p>
<p><strong>1.3. Server Selection</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 Europe servers: Frankfurt, London, and Ireland. Matches must be played on one of the Europe servers, unless otherwise agreed by both teams.
Teams are encouraged to come to an agreement regarding server choice; stability and making sure the match is not disrupted is a priority. If such an agreement cannot be reached, the team that did not choose the map for the final match (i.e. the second last team to make a map ban/pick) gets server choice.</p>
<p><strong>1.4. Team Names</strong></p>
<p>Team names may only contain alphanumeric characters (Abc123), spaces ( ) and a maximum of two (2) of the permitted special characters (,’.!). Team names may be up to twenty (20) characters long.</p>
<p><strong>1.5. Same Account</strong></p>
<p>Every player must compete only with the account they provide during registration. If you wish to use a different account than the one you registered with, please notify the Admins or TOs prior to the start of the competition.
Failure to comply with this rule may result in disqualification.</p>

In the event that the changes modify a Series schedule, the staff will notify all Teams as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>2.3. Check-ins</strong></p>
<p>Players should check in at the specified time.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.3.1. No-shows</strong></em></p>
<p>If a player fails to show up, the team may have up to 10 minutes after the start of the match to find an eligible substitute. They must already be on the roster at the time registration closes or rosters lock.</p>

<p>Teams may be disqualified or receive penalties for being late or being unable to produce an eligible substitute.

<p>Between Matches in a BoX Series, teams may substitute in any number of players.
These substitutions must be declared to a tournament official and to the opposing team.</p>
