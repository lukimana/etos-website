# ETOS Website

These are all the files needed to edit and publish the [ETOS Website][https://etos.pro).

## Install and Usage

This project uses [hugo]([http://nodejs.org](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)) and the Template [hugo-scroll]([https://npmjs.com](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-scroll/)).

This Repo contains all the files hugo needs to create the website as well as the created website itself. Hugo builds the website in the /public folder, which can be copied to be directly used by your webserver e.g NGINX.
