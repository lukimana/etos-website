## 1. Registration

* Registration deadlines need to be upheld to the times on start.gg.

* Registration must be done with a player account name either sent through Discord or displayed on start.gg in order to do proper seeding.

* Contact staff if something with registration is messing up on our end or if you have any questions.

* No slurs can be present in registration for the team names or player names.

* No manipulation of seeding through external factors such as forcing lower or higher elo teams to drop out from external pressure, registering on a smurf account, etc.

* Registration for a Floppa Cup tournament means you are giving consent to your games being streamed on Twitch and used for content/videos by the ETOS team.

## 4. Player Etiquette

* No flaming or witch hunting, if any issues occur during the tournament about player behavior contact staff immediately. 

* Politeness is a requirement, emote spam is acceptable, targeting specific players and emote spamming them is not. This will be enforced only with the wish of a targeted player in case the situation is ‘’friendly banter’’ or an inside joke.

* Players of every skill level are allowed to participate, help them learn and grow if you can, do not shame them for their ranks.

----

## 5.  Prizes for Competing

* Prize pools will depend from Floppa to Floppa, the first Floppa Cup will have a prize of 30€, that might not be the case later.

* This is a tournament for fun competition first, training ground second.

* Donations to the charity pool for the tournament prizes are acceptable.

* Ody Points will be provided by Odyssey Interactive. (Thank them very much)

* In-game rewards might be a possibility in the future.

----

## 6.  Pre-Match and Post-Match Instructions

* We are not responsible for teams checking in.

* If your match is to be streamed please wait for a tournament organizer (TO) to provide the lobby code.

* Once again uphold integrity in pre-game chat.

* Organizing lobbies can be done in Discord with screenshots for the staff.

* Post game result screen (stat screen) and winning team in your report or update the start.gg page.

----

## 7. Internet, Lag and Performance Issues

* [*Juno White Flag*](../images/juno_flag.png) and [*Asher Whistle*](../images/juno_flag.png) are both emotes to stop the game in case of external issues that do not allow a player to continue participating or very bad server lag that requires a match to be paused.

* If something happens for a match to be paused please call staff immediately.
