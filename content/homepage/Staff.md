ETOS isn't run by a single person. There are many people in the background, each adding their own part to make ETOS possible. You can find the the complete list of credits [here.](staff)

But we don't wanna stop here yet! There are some current positions and future positions where the ETOS team would appreciate a helping hand with:

**Broadcasters**

**Casters**

**Content Creators**

Just hop onto the [Discord](https://discord.gg/84jYdRqEnY) to apply!
